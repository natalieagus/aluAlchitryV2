TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.191 ns between aluManual/D_dffA_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by P_clk_0) and aluManual/D_outputAlu_q_reg[12]/D (clocked by P_clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.637 ns between aluManual/D_dffA_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by P_clk_0) and aluManual/D_outputAlu_q_reg[13]/D (clocked by P_clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
